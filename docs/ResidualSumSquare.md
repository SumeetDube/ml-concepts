The `model.score()` method in Scikit-learn is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. The specific metric it uses depends on whether the model is a classifier or a regressor.

## For Classification Models

When used with classification models, `model.score(X_test, y_test)` computes the accuracy of the model. Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances in the test set. The method takes two parameters:

- `X_test`: The feature matrix for the test set.
- `y_test`: The true labels for the test set.

The score returned is a float representing the proportion of correct predictions, with a maximum possible score of 1.0, indicating perfect accuracy[1][2][4].

## For Regression Models

In the case of regression models, `model.score(X_test, y_test)` calculates the coefficient of determination, commonly referred to as $$ R^2 $$. This metric indicates how well the model's predictions approximate the actual data. The formula for $$ R^2 $$ is given by:

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}}
$$

where RSS (Residual Sum of Squares) measures the variance in the prediction errors, and TSS (Total Sum of Squares) measures the variance in the actual data. The $$ R^2 $$ value can range from negative infinity to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit[2][3].

In summary, `model.score()` provides a straightforward way to assess the performance of a model in Scikit-learn, using accuracy for classification tasks and $$ R^2 $$ for regression tasks.

### Example 1: Using a Single-Cell Gene Expression Dataset

This example uses a t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique on a dataset of Arabidopsis thaliana root cells.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://reneshbedre.github.io/assets/posts/tsne/tsne_scores.csv")

# Perform DBSCAN clustering
clusters = DBSCAN(eps=4.54, min_samples=4).fit(df)

# Get cluster labels
labels = clusters.labels_

# Check unique clusters
unique_clusters = set(labels)

# Count cluster sizes
cluster_sizes = Counter(labels)

# Visualization
p = sns.scatterplot(data=df, x="t-SNE-1", y="t-SNE-2", hue=labels, legend="full", palette="deep")
sns.move_legend(p, "upper right", bbox_to_anchor=(1.17, 1.), title='Clusters')
plt.show()
```

In this example, the DBSCAN algorithm identified 11 clusters, with the largest cluster containing 1524 data points.

### Example 2: Mall Customer Segmentation

This example uses a dataset of mall customers to demonstrate clustering based on age, income, and spending score.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Mall_Customers.csv')
X_train = df[['Age', 'Annual Income (k$)', 'Spending Score (1-100)']]

# Fit DBSCAN
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=12.5, min_samples=4).fit(X_train)

# Create a new DataFrame with cluster labels
DBSCAN_dataset = X_train.copy()
DBSCAN_dataset['Cluster'] = clustering.labels_

# Count clusters
cluster_counts = DBSCAN_dataset['Cluster'].value_counts()

# Visualization
plt.scatter(DBSCAN_dataset['Annual Income (k$)'], DBSCAN_dataset['Spending Score (1-100)'], c=DBSCAN_dataset['Cluster'])
plt.xlabel('Annual Income (k$)')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')
plt.title('DBSCAN Clustering of Mall Customers')
plt.show()
```

In this case, DBSCAN identified 5 clusters, with one outlier.

### Example 3: Synthetic Data Generation

This example generates synthetic data using `make_blobs` and applies DBSCAN.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create synthetic data
centers = [[1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, -1]]
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=750, centers=centers, cluster_std=0.4, random_state=0)
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

# Fit DBSCAN
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=0.3, min_samples=5).fit(X)

# Visualization
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=dbscan.labels_, cmap='plasma')
plt.title('DBSCAN Clustering on Synthetic Data')
plt.show()
```

This example demonstrates how DBSCAN can effectively identify clusters in synthetic data, highlighting its ability to handle arbitrary shapes and noise.

These examples illustrate the versatility and application of DBSCAN in different contexts, from real-world datasets to synthetic data generation.

------
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups based on their density. It is particularly useful for finding clusters of arbitrary shape and size in the presence of noise and outliers.

Key aspects of DBSCAN:

- It groups together data points that are close to each other based on a distance measure (e.g. Euclidean distance) and a density threshold[1][2][3].

- The algorithm requires two parameters: eps (maximum distance between two points for them to be considered as in the same neighborhood) and minPts (minimum number of points required to form a dense region)[1][2][3].
- eps - max distance
- minPts - no of pts to form region

- It classifies data points into three categories: core points (have at least minPts points in their eps neighborhood), border points (are in the neighborhood of a core point but have less than minPts points), and noise points (neither core nor border points)[1][3][4].

- Clusters are formed by density reachability - a point p is density reachable from a point q if there is a path p1, ..., pn with p1 = q, pn = p, where each pi+1 is directly density reachable from pi[2][5].

- DBSCAN has advantages over algorithms like K-Means as it can find clusters of arbitrary shape, does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance, and is robust to noise[1][3][4].

- However, it struggles with datasets having varying densities and is sensitive to the choice of eps and minPts parameters[4].

In summary, DBSCAN is a powerful density-based clustering algorithm that can discover clusters of any shape and size from large datasets with noise, making it useful for applications like image segmentation, anomaly detection, and spatial data analysis[3][4][5].
